                  <p style="font-size:130%; padding-left:5px; color: #cbe0f1;text-align:justify;">In 2016, the system of MBBS admission to the government and private medical colleges is completely changed. The government & The private medical colleges in India would be
allowed to admit students on merit of NEET .The Indian students aspiring to become doctor find it difficult to get a medical seat in India. As a result, There is only option remains
MBBS abroad.

From 2017 onward, the system would be smoother when the government and private medical colleges would be strictly through merit through one entrance test – NEET 2017.
Once the results are announced for 12th standard boards in April / May every year and after the AIPMT in May, the student generally knows where he or she stands in the
competition. Hence, this is the right time for the student to carve a Plan B for themselves. The biggest benefit of MBBS abroad is you can study in MBBS abroad college /
university without any entrance as well as low costs to study!
In general, Indian students aspiring to become medical practitioner must understand the 3 options lying in front of you right from the beginning.<br><br>




</p> 
<p style="font-size:130%; padding-left:5px; color: #cbe0f1;text-align:justify;">
While the first one is the best option but it is very difficult to get the admission to MCI approved government medical colleges in India, the second option is actually out of reach
of most of the Indians since it costs Rs 75 Lacs upward. Hence, the only option remaining is to study MBBS in abroad in a MCI approved university.
The best way to ensure that you take admission in this year itself is by reserving a medical seat for MBBS admission abroad now while continuing your try in Indian medical
system. Hence, the first thing is to find out a good MBBS abroad consultant. Taking a MBBS admission in abroad is definitely a confusing for many Indian students.
Though Guidance World places the students to top medical colleges in aboard.
